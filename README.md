# MedicalMNISTClassification
I have implemented a CNN using Python and TensorFlow framework to classify radiological images from the Medical MNIST dataset. The dataset is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/medical-mnist) . This dataset consists of 58954 images with 6 different classes. I managed to train, validate and test my neural network by achieving an accuracy of 99.52% on the test data.
